# ArseLinux OS

A silly bum themed Linux distribution


# Purpose
To learn Linux via a silly project


# Contribute
Anyone can contribute to this, I just want to allow anyone the ability to learn on something that isn't serious and any skills you do gain can be used to benefit the greater open source community. 

- Doesn't matter if you break something (It's not like it's in a great state now)
- Just have fun trying to build a real distribution from scratch
