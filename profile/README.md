# ArseLinux OS

A silly bum themed Linux distribution


# Purpose
To learn Linux via a silly project


# Contribute
Anyone can contribute to this, I created this to allow me to learn and to allow anyone the ability to learn on something that isn't serious and any skills you do gain can be used to benefit the greater open source community. 

- Doesn't matter the quality of the contribution as long as it was made with good intentions
- Just have fun :)
